# Machine_Learning_with_Python

The repository is the result from the course ['Machine Learning with Python' from Coursera offered by IBM](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python).

This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. In this course, we will be reviewing two main components:
First, we will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world.  Second, we will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.

### [Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/megam5/Machine_Learning_with_Python/tree/master/Week_1_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning)

This week, you will learn about the applications of Machine Learning in different fields such as health care, banking, etc. Youâ€™ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, and the usage of each algorithm. Also, you'll understand the advantages of using Python libraries for implementing Machine Learning models.
