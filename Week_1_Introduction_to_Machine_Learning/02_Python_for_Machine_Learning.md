# Week 1

This week, you will learn about the applications of Machine Learning in different fields such as health care, banking, etc.
Youâ€™ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, and the usage of each algorithm.
Also, you'll understand the advantages of using Python libraries for implementing Machine Learning models.

## Python for Machine Learning

Python is a popular and powerful general-purpose programming language that recently emerged as the preferred language among data scientists. You can write your machine-learning algorithms using Python and it works very well. However, there are a lot of modules and libraries already implemented in Python, which can make your life much easier. We'll try to introduce the Python packages in this course.

#### Python libraries for Machine Learning

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org): The first package is NumPy which is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python.
It enables you to do computation efficiently and effectively. It is better than regular Python because of its amazing capabilities.
For example, for working with arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes and working with images you need to know NumPy.

- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org): SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
SciPy is a good library for scientific and high performance computation.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): Matplotlib is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): Pandas library is a very high-level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures.
It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis.
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries.

- [SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning which our focus here is.
SciKit Learn is a free Machine Learning Library for the Python programming language.
It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific libraries; NumPy and SciPy.
Also, it includes very good documentation.
On top of that, implementing machine learning models with SciKit Learn is easy with a few lines of Python code.

Most of the tasks that need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are implemented already in Scikit Learn including pre-processing
of data, feature selection, feature extraction, train test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models, tuning parameters, 
prediction, evaluation and exporting the model.
The most important point to remember is that the entire process of a machine learning task can be done simply in a few lines of code using SciKit Learn.
Please notice that though it is possible, it would not be that easy if you want to do all of this using NumPy or SciPy packages.
And of course, it needs much more coding if you use pure Python programming to implement all of these tasks.
